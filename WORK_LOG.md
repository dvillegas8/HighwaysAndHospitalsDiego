However, something I came up with was to at the end once we figure out the cost including the highways, at the end we would check if it is cheaper to build the hospitals in each city. Additionally, I wrote down some of the problems on a piece of paper to see how would I approach this but I came up with nothing. I am clueless on how to start doing this problem, however, I do still think my idea of finding the most common city might be a good start. |

Wrote the code for the sorting, just need to debug and check to see if it works. |

| September 12  | 9:30 - 10:00  | Finished fixing my sorting code, added an if statement for when we calculate min cost using our method, we would then calculate the amount of cities * hospital cost to see if it is cheaper to only build hospitals. Added an if statement to a situation where if it was only two cities. Wasn't sure how I would approach this next, but I thought of since the array is sorted I can just count how many of the first element is there and build 1 hospital and do count * highway cost . However, I would have to keep track of duplicates. For example, if there is a city called (1,3) then I would ignore (3,1) because I already know there would be a hospital build at 1 |
